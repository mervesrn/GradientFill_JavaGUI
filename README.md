Gradient Fill
In this labwork I writed a GUI application again using AWT. This is a fairly easy labwork that is more about getting used to synchronized online learning.<br>

To do this work,<br>
• Draw two rectangles.<br>
• Both of them should be filled using GradientPaint() function of AWT. (Check out its
function definition that is listed below.)<br>
• The first gradient should be parallel to the diagonal of the first rectangle. The color
gradient should not be repeated (acyclic).<br>
• The second gradient should be horizontal. The color gradient should be repeated for
this one (cyclic).<br>
• You are free to choose the colors but other than that your output should be similar to
the example screenshot given below.<br>
